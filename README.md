<h1>Create an AppaApps Photo App!</h1>

<h1 id="tywn" >Things you will need to create an interesting app</h1>
</a>

<p>"Tutta la nostra conoscenza ha le sue origini nelle nostre percezioni"
- Leonardo Da Vinci</p>

<p>"Die Grenzen meiner Sprache sind die Grenzen meiner Welt" - Ludwig
Wittgenstein</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.appaapps.com/howToWriteAnApp.html#know">
<h2 id="know" >Knowledge</h2>
</a>

<p>The most important thing you will need to write an interesting app is
interest and knowledge about a subject that you can illustrate with photos and
describe with facts.  For example: if you are know a lot about horses; have
access to lots of illustrative photos of horses doing interesting things; and
you can describe the important features of these photos in a few succinct words;
then you have a good basis for writing an interesting app about horses. Or
perhaps jet aircraft. Or growing roses.

<p>The app generation process synthesizes speech from your facts, then packages
the speech together with your photos to create an immersive Android app. The
app teaches students by showing them the photos, gradually introducing the
spoken facts, then using the facts as questions for which the student must
choose the matching photos.

<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.appaapps.com/howToWriteAnApp.html#computer">
<h2 id="computer" >A Computer and an Android Phone or Tablet</h2>
</a>

<p>You will need a small amount of computer equipment:

<ol>

<li>A computer with an Internet connection

<li>An Android device if you want to play the app as a native Android app on a
phone or tablet

</ol>

<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.appaapps.com/howToWriteAnApp.html#how">
<h1 id="how" >How to write an AppaApps Photo App</h1>
</a>

<p>To create an app in the <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> format follow these instructions:

<p><div class=borderToc>
<tr><td><ol>

<li><a href="#cfao">Create a free account</a> on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> if you do not already
have one.

</ol>

</ol>
</div>

<p><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> will then tell <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> to generate the app for you: <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> will
send you a notification via email when the app is ready for you to download and
play.

<p>You will be able to see all the notifications related to your repository
under the <b>Issues</b> tab in the top centre left of your repository's home
page:

<p><image src="images/gitHubIssues.png">

<p>and also in your email, depending on how quickly your email updates (possibly
under Spam):

<p><image src="images/yahooEmail.png">

<p>If you get stuck, create an issue against your repository by clicking on the
word <b>Issues</b> in the top centre left of your repository's home page:
<p><image src="images/createAnIssue.png"> <p>and the push the green "Create
Issue" button. <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> will be pleased to collaborate with you to resolve the

<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and follow the instructions to create a free account, keeping
the alert below in mind:

<p><div class="borderSecurityAlert">

<p>Please make sure that your userid name on GitHub starts with an upper or
lowercase letter in the range <b><big>A to Z</big></b> and thereafter only
contains upper or lowercase letters <b><big>A to Z</big></b> and/or digits
<b><big>0 to 9</big></b>. The inclusion of any other letters will cause the app
generation process to fail.

<p>Thus userid: <b>user1</b> will work well.

<p>While userids: <b>1user</b>, <b>user 1</b>, <b>user𝝰</b> will all fail
miserably.

<p>You are now ready to create a new <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> repository to contain your apps

</a>

<p>When you create your repository you can select <b>public</b> or
<b>private</b> for the type of repository (or <b>repo</b>). We advise you to
select <b>public</b> because:

<ol>

<li><p>Public repositories are free on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>

<li><p>Apps created from both public and private repositories will not remain
private on publication because you have no control over the distribution of
your apps when you publish. Even if you publish on restricted circulation, the
people you publish to might redistribute your apps.

<li><p>We cannot guarantee the security of data exchanged between you and
<b>AppaApps</b>: Recent global IT security breaches (i.e. The Pentagon, the NHS,
the UK Information Commissioner and UK council websites) tell us that in the
world we live in, no IT system or website can be 100% secure. <b>AppaApps</b>
works to industry standards of information security but this can not guarantee
the security of your app content prior to publishing. <b>Any</b> IT system can
be hacked!

</ol>

</div>

<p><image src="images/createRepo/2.png">

<p>Choose a simple, short name for your repository: please make sure that the
name of the repository contains only letters and numbers drawn from <b>a</b>
through <b>z</b>, <b>A</b> through <b>Z</b>, <b>0</b> through <b>9</b> and
<b>_</b> (underscore). The name must start with a letter and must not contain
spaces, commas or any other punctuation characters else chaos will ensue.

<p>Choose the option of initializing the repository with a <b>README</b> -
which once created can be left blank for the moment. At this point you can skip
the other options: <b>GitIgnore</b> and <b>choosing a licence</b>.

<p>Press the green <b>Create Repository</b> button to create the repository.

<a href="http://www.appaapps.com/howToWriteAnApp.html#iatw">
<h3 id="iatw" >Authorize <b>AppaApps</b> to collaborate with you</h3>
</a>

<p>Once you have created a repository on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and before you add any files
to it, you should invite <a href="mailto:philiprbrenan@gmail.com">philiprbrenan@gmail.com</a> to be a collaborator by clicking the
word <b>Settings</b> in the top centre right of your repository's home page,
then click <b>Collaborators</b> at the top of the left side bar:

<p><image src="images/collaborators/1.png">

<p>Enter <b>AppaApps</b> as the name of the collaborator in the search box
and push the button: <b>Add collaborator</b>. <b>AppaApps</b> will now be
able to answer any questions you pose by creating issues on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. To create
an issue, click on the word <b>Issues</b> in the left top corner of your
repository's home page.

<p><b>AppaApps</b> will respond to your invitation to collaborate by connecting
your newly created repository to <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> and creating some useful files and
folders in your new repository. You will receive a notification from GitHub
once this work has been done; usually it takes just a few moment.

<p>Once notified by <b>AppaApps</b> that the web hook has been created, you will
be able to see the web hook connecting your repository to <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> by clicking
as follows:

<p>Go to <b>repository settings</b>:
<p><image src="images/checkWebHook/1.png">

<p>Click on <b>web hooks</b> to get:
<p><image src="images/checkWebHook/2.png">

<p>You can click on the web hook to see its details:
<p><image src="images/checkWebHook/3.png">

<p>You can also see when the web hook last notified <b>AppaApps</b> at the bottom
of the image above.

<p>You can delete this web hook at any time to disconnect your repository from
<a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> if you wish to end this collaboration.

<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.appaapps.com/howToWriteAnApp.html#wya">
<h2 id="wya" >Write your app</h2>
</a>

<p>If you have received notification from <b>AppaApps</b> that the web hook is in
position as described above, you can then start to load your repository
with images and text as described in the next sections to actually create your
app.

<a href="http://www.appaapps.com/howToWriteAnApp.html#atip">
<h3 id="atip" >Add some interesting photos to the images/ folder</h3>
</a>

<p>Now that you have a repository ready to go you can start development of your
app. The first thing to do is to find some of photos that illustrate the points
you wish to make and load them into the <a href="#atip">images</a> folder in your new repository.
To do this, click on <b>images</b>:

<p><image src="images/uploadFiles/uploadFiles1.png">

<p>which will take you into the <b>images</b> folder.

<p><image src="images/uploadFiles/uploadFiles2.png">

<p>Click on the <b>upload files</b> tab to get:

<p><image src="images/uploadFiles/uploadFiles3.png">

<p>Click on the <b>choose your files link</b>:

<p><image src="images/uploadFiles/uploadFiles4.png">

<p>On this page you can choose the files you wish to upload.

<p>You will probably find it easiest to load a small number of images first,
say three or four, so that you can create a prototype app and then improve it
by adding more photos as you see fit.

<p>Every time you save a photo into your repository <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a>, being a
collaborator, will receive a message indicating that this has been done.
<a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> responds to this message by creating or updating the file
<b>sourceFile.sample.txt</b> in your repository. This file shows what a very
basic app using these photos you have supplied might look like and so serves as
a useful template for further development.

<a href="http://www.appaapps.com/howToWriteAnApp.html#wdtf">
<h3 id="wdtf" >Write the facts for each photo</h3>
</a>

<p>You should write the facts for each photo in a file called <a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a>.  You
can have as many of these files as you wish in your repository as long as they
are in separate folders as you can see in: <a href="genHtmlStart">The Numbers
from 0 to 100</a> which uses one folder to hold the <a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a> file for each
language.

<p>You might find it helpful to use a text editor such as:
<a href="https://www.geany.org/Download/Releases">Geany</a> to edit <a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a> as in:
<p><image src="images/Geany/1.png">

<p>Each time you save a new version of any <a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a> into your GitHub
repository, <b>AppaApps</b> will try to generate an app from the definition held
in the file and will notify you of the results of the generation process via
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> issues and email.  If your <a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a> looks good, an issue will be
immediately created saying so. The app generation process will then synthesize
any speech needed and combine it with the photos in an Android Package
<b>.apk</b> file suitable for installation on any Android device.

<p>If the app generation process fails you will receive an issue via <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
that describes the problem allowing you to fix your <a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a> and continue.

<p>An easy way to create the <a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a> file is to copy the contents of
<b>sourceFile.sample.txt</b> which is a sample version of this file created for
you by <b>AppaApps</b> each time you save a photo into your <a href="#atip">images</a> folder.

<p>Here is a sample listing of the files in a <a
href="https://github.com/philiprbrenan/GoneFishing">GitHub repository</a>:

<p><image src="images/repoContents.png">

<p>You can see the <a href="#atip">images</a> folder on the first line and the files
<b>sourceFile.sample.txt</b> and <a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a> on the last two lines.

<p>Here are the first few lines of a typical <b>sourceFile.sample.txt</b> file:

<div class="codeBack">

</pre>
</div>

<p>The file: <a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a> will be processed by a computer at <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> to create
your app. Consequently, the information in this file has to be organized in a
specific manner so that it can be processed by a computer rather than an
intelligent human being.

<p>A complete definition of the format of this file  is given in section <a
href="#sft">Layout of sourceFile.txt</a>.

<p>For your first app the easiest thing to do is use
<b>sourceFile.sample.txt</b> as an example and type the facts that you are
going to use over the text "First fact about" and "Another fact about" and save
the results in file: <a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a> in your new repository.

<p> You are bound to make mistakes in the process of generating an app, but
such mistakes are not fatal because you can always try again.  If <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a>
cannot generate an app for you from the information you have provided in
<a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a>, then <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> will create an issue on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> explaining the problem
and you will be notified of this by email. You can use this information to
correct your <a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a>. When you commit this file to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> will try
to generate the app again for you.

<p>If you get hopelessly stuck, just create an issue yourself by clicking on
the word <b>Issues</b> located in the top left corner of the home page for your
repository (just under then name of your repository) and someone at <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a>
will be pleased to respond if <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> has been invited to act as a
collaborator on your app.

<p><a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> will attempt to regenerate your app each time you commit, that is:
save a new version of <a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a> to your repository on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. You do not need
to perform any other action other than waiting for the notification that
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> will send you once <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> has finished regenerating your app.

<p>If you wish to receive such notifications by email, then you should make
sure that you are watching your repository as described in:

<a href="wyr">Set up your notification preferences</a>.

<p>Or you can look in the <b>issues</b> section of your repository
and pick up the notifications from there as they come in.

<p>If <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> successfully creates an app for you from the photos and facts
that you provided in <a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a>, the email from <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> will tell you where to go
to download your app from the cloud to your phone and where you can play the
app in your web browser. This allows you to try out the latest version of your
app immediately and make any improvements you think desirable after admiring
your app in action.

<h2 id="commands" >Commands</h2>
</a>

<p>An app description tells <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> how to create an AppaApps Photo App for you using
commands in a well defined language. This language has been designed to be
simple to code by non technical authors yet powerful enough to express the
information required to fully define an AppaApps Photo App.

<p>An <b>app description</b> starts with a single <a href="#cmdDef_app">app</a> command followed by
additional <a href="#cmdDef_photo">photo</a> and <a href="#cmdDef_fact">fact</a> commands. The action of each command is
defined by the values of its associated keywords. The commands and their
keywords tell <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> how to create the app for you. You can add notes to
yourself by coding a <b><bold>#</bold></b> sign followed by the content of your
note up to the end of the same line.

<p><table border=1 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=10>
<tr><th>Command<th>Description

<tr>
<th align=left class=command><a href="#cmdDef_app" class=command>app</a>
<td>The first command should be
an <a href="#cmdDef_app">app</a> command whose keywords specify global values for the app.

<tr>
<th align=left class=command><a href="#cmdDef_photo" class=command>photo</a>
<td>For each <a href="#cmdDef_photo">photo</a>
that you want to include in an AppaApps Photo App, you should code one <a href="#cmdDef_photo">photo</a>
command to give the <a href="#cmdDef_photo">photo</a> a <b>name</b> and <b>title</b> and to tell
<a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> where the <a href="#cmdDef_photo">photo</a> is located on the Internet so that the <a href="#cmdDef_photo">photo</a>
can be retrieved and displayed in the app.

<tr>
<th align=left class=command><a href="#cmdDef_fact" class=command>fact</a>
<td>Use the <a href="#cmdDef_fact">fact</a> command
to provide facts for each <a href="#cmdDef_photo">photo</a>. These facts will be used to teach and
then test the users of the generated app.

</table>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.appaapps.com/howToWriteAnApp.html#kav">
<h2 id="kav" >Keywords and values</h2>
</a>

<p>The action of each command is modified by its following <b>keyword
<bold>=</bold> value</b> pairs, coded one pair per line. Upper and lower case
are interchangeable in keyword names and underscores <b>_</b> are not
considered significant, so, for example, you can code the keyword:

<table cellspacing=20>
<tr><th>fullPackageNameForGooglePlay
<tr><td>as:
<tr><th>full_package_name__for___Google______play
</table>
if you wish.

<p>Keywords cannot have spaces in them, so:

<table cellspacing=20>
<tr><th>full Package     Name For Google Play
</table>

would not be regarded as a keyword causing the app generation to fail.

<p> Values occupy the remainder of the line. Leading and trailing white space
around the value will be ignored. Spaces are allowed inside the value so:

<table cellspacing=20>
<tr><th>description = Robot descending from the sky
</table>

would work well as a keyword value pair.

<p>You can turn a <b>keyword <bold>=</bold> value</b> line into a helpful
comment that will be ignored by <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> by preceding the line with a
<b>#</b> as in:

<table cellspacing=20>
<tr><td>  # <td> maxImages = 12
</table>

<p>Later on, if you change your mind and want <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> to take note of this
information, you can remove the <b>#</b> to bring the keyword and its
associated value back into play.

<p>Here is a list of the current keywords, their possible values and what
happens if you code them:

<p><table cellspacing=10 cellpadding=10 border=1>

<tr><th>Command<th>Key<th>Required<th>Description<th>Default<th>Possibilities

did not understand the normal fast speech version can be given a slower,
more comprehensible version on redirect.

<p>Code a number for the value of this keyword: any phrase that has fewer
characters than this number will cause both normal and emphasized versions of
the speech to be generated. Phrases longer than this number will only cause a
normal version of the speech to be generated.

<p>If you omit this keyword or code a value of zero then only normal speech

<p>If you do not want to use <b>jpx</b>, code this keyword with a value of

keyword to specify the number of levels in the game and have the app generation
system allocate photos to each level based on their position in <a href="#sft"><bold>sourceFile.txt</bold></a>.

organization.  The app will scale this text to fit the screen, so if you want
the name to be in large visible letters it must contain only a few characters.
Conversely, long names will be shrunk down to fit the display and will probably
be unreadable.

race continues as long as the student does not make too many mistakes or until
all the items that the student has previously identified correctly have been
presented. Race mode questions are presented with less delay than normal
questions.

<p>The race starts with well known items and with quiet background music. As the
race proceeds, the music gets louder and the questions become more difficult as
measured by how often the student has correctly identified the items in the
past.

<p>The objective of a race is to set a personal best time for completing a race
through all the items in the app without errors.

<p>At the end of race, the student is congratulated if they did not make too
many mistakes. Play then reverts to normal mode.

<p>Code this keyword if you would like this photo to be made into a screen
shot. You will need screen shots to upload your app to distribution web sites.
This keyword gives you a convenient way to mark the photos in your app that
would make the best screen shots.

<p>To actually take screen shots you will needs to code the <a
href="#cmdKeyDef_app_screenShots">app.screenShots=</a> keyword to temporarily
enable screen shot mode.  During screen shot mode, the app shows just the
indicated items either centered on their <a
href="#cmdKeyDef_photo_pointsOfInterest"> first point of interest</a> or
moving so slowly that you can manually swipe the screen to take the shot when
the photo is best presented on the screen.

<p>By default the screen shots will be placed in your <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> repository in:

<pre>
  out/screenShots/photoname.jpg.
</pre>

<p>However, you can specify an alternate repository in to which screen shots
are to be saved, see the <a

details.

<p>This feature only works for the first two hours after an app has been
created: after that the app plays normally.

<p>The title for this photo. Take care not to use a question!  The title of the
photo will be used as both a question and an answer by the app and so if you
add words such "Is this" or punctuation such as "?" to make it a question then
the usage as a question might work, but the usage as an answer will not.

<p>The title should be as short as is feasible. If the title contains redundant
text which is repeated from photo to photo, then the app becomes an app for
teaching the student the redundant text rather than the original material as it
is the redundant text that the student will hear the most and thus learn
the first.

<p>This gives rise to the most important rule of educational game development:
<b>everything must change except the truth</b>.

<p>Use the <a href="#cmdKeyDef_photo_say">photo.say=</a> keyword if you wish
to say something other than the title when describing the photo.

<p>This keyword describes the location of a photo be retrieved and used in this 
app.

<p>If the URL starts with <b>https?://</b> then this is the location of the
image on the World Wide Web from whence it will be copied. For example:

<pre>
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7d/Bliss.png
</pre>

<p>If the URL starts with <b>github://</b> then this is the location of the
image in another GitHub repository: code the user name, '/', repository name,
'/', followed by the path in the repository to the image file.  For example:

<pre>
  github://philiprbrenan/vocabulary-1/images/Ant.jpg
</pre>

<p>Otherwise it is the name of a  file in the <a href="#atip">images</a> folder in the <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
repository for this app.  For example:

<pre>
  Ant.jpg
</pre>

<p>Photos should be high resolution: crop the photo to centre the object of
interest and remove extraneous details.

<p>The app will move long thin or tall narrow photos around on the screen so
that the student can see all of their contents.  This leads to a motion effect
which is desirable for apps about skyscrapers, airplanes, bridges, boats, trees
etc. as it adds realism.  To reduce this effect: crop the photos into squares,
to accentuate it: stick photos together in a long line.

<p>The student will be able to pan and zoom the photos in the app to see fine
details so it is worth using high resolution photos to facilitate this
capability. Conversely, low resolution photos will pixellate if the student
zooms them.

<p>If you include identifiable people in your photos in an app you should
get signed model releases from the persons involved.

<p>If you do not specify this keyword, then the text of <a 
href="#cmdKeyDef_photo_url">photo.afewchars=</a> keyword will be displayed. If 
both keywords are used then the text will be displayed on top of the photo.

</a>

<p>Normally you should place the command name alone on the first line and then
follow the command with one or more <b>keyword</b> <b><bold>=</bold></b>
<b>value</b> pairs on subsequent lines.  To save space, the <b>command</b>
and the <b>name</b> and <b>title</b> keywords can be combined into one line. So
the code:

<pre>
  photo
    name  = white.cliffs
    title = The "White Cliffs of Dover" from an arriving ferry
</pre>

<p>can be combined to save space by writing it as:

<pre>
  photo white.cliffs = The "White Cliffs of Dover" from an arriving ferry
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.appaapps.com/howToWriteAnApp.html#matchingNames">
<h2 id="matchingNames" >Matching names</h2>
</a>

<p>An app is built from photos and facts. Each corresponding <a href="#cmdDef_photo">photo</a> and
each <a href="#cmdDef_fact">fact</a> should have a <b>name <bohtmlTld>=</bold> value</b> keyword/value
pair to specify a label and description for the photo or fact. The names are
matched so that in the following:

<pre>
  photo sky       = The sky above us
  photo sky.blue  = Blue skies over the sea
  photo sky.red   = Sunset

  fact sky      = The heavens above us
  fact sky.blue = Lots of sun shine soon
  fact sky.grey = Rain will fall soon
</pre>

<p>the following matches will be made:
<p><table cellspacing=10 cellpadding=10 border=1>

<p>The student will be tested on the word <b>sky</b> and the phrase <i>"The sky
above us"</i> using all three <a href="#cmdDef_photo">photo</a>s.

<p>However, with the above source code the student will never see <i>"Rain will
fall soon"</i> as the <a href="#cmdDef_fact">fact</a> named <b>sky.grey</b> does not match the name
of any <a href="#cmdDef_photo">photo</a>. Adding a <a href="#cmdDef_photo">photo</a> with a name, for example,
<b>sky.grey.rain</b> would bring this <a href="#cmdDef_fact">fact</a> into play by matching the name
of the <a href="#cmdDef_photo">photo</a> with the <a href="#cmdDef_fact">fact</a>'s name of <b>sky.grey</b>.

<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.appaapps.com/howToWriteAnApp.html#rewards">
<h1 id="rewards" >Notifications and Rewards</h1>
</a>

<p>Each app prompts its user, on occasion, to send a copy of the app to their 
friends to encourage the organic growth of the app's user base through student 
to student distribution:

<p><image src="images/rewards/recommendAppToAFriend.png">

<p>Such distribution is very valuable to an app author because it results in 
their app being more widely seen. Indeed, wide distribution is crucial if the 
author's goal is to use the app to locate people to fill a job or 
apprenticeship with people who have a genuine interest in the author's subject 
matter of as indicated by their willingness to play an app about it.

<p>Imagine then for a moment that Anna has created an app that has been 
distributed as follows until it eventually reached Dora who has learned to play 
the app so well that the app prompts Dora to contact Anna to see if she can 
have a place on Anna's apprentice training scheme.

<pre>
  Anna     - the app author sends her app to:
  Beatrice - an early adopter, who recommends it to:
  Cuthbert - who knows just the person to send it to:
  Dora     - who learns so much that the app prompts her to contact Anna
</pre>

<p>Distribution of this nature is so valuable that Anna might wish to contact 
Beatrice and Cuthbert to discuss how they can help distribute Anna's app 
further. 

<p>However, to fully comply with: <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation"> 
European Union: General Data Protection Regulation </a> <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> does not 
record any information that might allow <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> to personally identify the 
people who have received and distributed copies of an app. Nor does <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> 
store their IP or MAC address, Google advertising ID or the phone's CPU id.

<p><a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> does store a large, unique, randonly chosen number in each app 
downloaded.  Every time Beatrice makes a recommendation to a potential student 
like Cuthbert, an encoded version of this number is included in the 
recommendation.  When Cuthbert downloads a copy of the recommended app from 
<a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a>, <a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> creates a new number for Cuthbert's app and records the 
connection between the app given to Beatrice and the app given to Cuthbert. The 
process is repeated when Cuthbert recommends the app to Dora. At no point does 
<a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> store any information that might enable any-one with access to 
<a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> to identify who in fact Beatrice, Cuthbert or Dora are. All that is 
recorded is that copies of the apps were distributed in a particular sequence. 

<p>Each time such a recommendation results in a new download, the <a href="#cmdKeyDef_app_author">author</a> will 
receive a notification that this has happened via a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> issue. The 
successful recommendation will also be recorded in the app's <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> repository 
in a file in the <b>downloads</b> folder as in:

<p><image src="images/rewards/appDownloadHasOccurred.png">

<p>The <b>From:</b> number is the encoded version of the unique number in 
Beatrice's copy of the app. The <b>To</b> Number is likewise the encoded 
version of the unique number placed in Cuthbert's copy of the app.

<p>Now imagine that Dora learns to play Anna's app so well that the she reaches 
a level of play, predetermined by Anna, at which point the app invites Dora to 
contact Anna to inquire about a place on Anna's training scheme.  If Dora 
accepts the invitation she sends an email to Anna which includes the encoded 
version of the secret number in her copy of the app.

<image src="images/excellentStudent">

<p>Anna is now particulary interested in how her app got to Dora because she 
would like to encourage the people who played a part in this chain of events to 
increase their efforts to see if more candidates such as Dora can be found. 
However, no-one knows the identities of these people! The only information that 
Anna has is the encoded forms of the unique secret numbers in each person's 
copy of the app.

<p>If Anna places an invitation in a file in the <b>rewards</b> folder of the 
repository containing her app using the <b>From identity</b> received from 
Dora:

<p><image src="images/rewards/offerAReward.png">

<p> then the next time that Cuthbert start Anna's app, the app will check for 
messages addressed to the unique secret number in his copy of the app. If 
Anna's message addresses that number then the app will show the message to 
Cuthbert.

<p><image src="images/rewards/offerResponseEmail.png">

<p>Cuthbert can then send this email to the app <a href="#cmdKeyDef_app_author">author</a> if he wishes:

<p><image src="images/rewards/receivedResponse.png">

<p>Cuthbert's email will contain a copy of the secret number contained in his 
copy of Anna's app.

<p>When Anna receives Cuthbert's email she can use the secret number to verify 
that Cuthbert's copy of the app  did indeeed recommend the app to Dora.

<p><image src="images/rewards/sha256.png">

<p>Conversely, if Eggbert gets in contact claiming that he is the person who 
distributed Anna's app so effectively, he will be unable to produce a matching 
secret number so his claim to fame can be safely dismissed. 

<p>To achieve this result each copy of an app contains a <span style="color:green"><b>unique secret number</b></span> known only to 
<a href="http://www.appaapps.com">AppaApps</a> and to the person downloading and installing the app. When they in 
turn send a recommendation email to another potential student, that email 
contains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">Sha-256</a> encoding of the <span style="color:green"><b>unique secret number</b></span>. This provides just enough 
information to allow Anna to invite only those people who contributed to 
getting the app to Dora and to validate their contribution should any of them 
choose to get in contact.

<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.appaapps.com/howToWriteAnApp.html#zandp">
<h1 id="zandp" >Zoom and Pan</h1>
</a>

<p>Students will be able to zoom and pan all the images in your app. This makes 
it worthwhile to use high resolution photos in your app, especially if they 
contain small details that the student can examine by zooming and panning. You 
can make your app more interesting by posing questions that will require the 
student to examine the photos carefully in detail to find the photos that 
answer your questions.

<p>To zoom any image: touch the image on the screen so that the action compass 
appears. Swipe <b>West</b> to the word <b>Move</b> to place the app in zoom and 
pan mode. Touching the screen again, without moving, will cause the image to be 
zoomed around the touched point. Moving your finger around on the screen will 
cause the photo to pan - to move - on the screen without being zoomed further 
so that areas hidden by the zoom can be brought into view and examined in more 
detail. Moving your finger and then stopping while still touching the screen 
causes the image to dezoom, that is to shrink, around the touch point.  To 
resume normal play: tap the screen quickly.

<h1 id="Administration" >Administration</h1>
</a>

<p>Authors should follow the instructions at <a href="#how">how to write an 
app</a> to create their apps on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. Apps defined on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> are converted 
into actual Android apps by code running on the server specified in the <a 
href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks">webhook</a> for the author's 
repository.

<p>To set up such a server 
<a href="https://github.com/coreliuOrg/photoApp/archive/master.zip">download</a>,
unzip into a convenient folder and locate:  

<pre>
  /home/phil/AppaAppsPhotoApp/AppaAppsPhotoApp.pm
</pre>

<p>This program can be used (amongst many other things) to set up and 
administer the servers used by app authors to convert their app descriptions on 
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> into Android apps. The administrator edits this file and runs it on 
their <b>local</b> system to transfer the necessary files to the <b>remote</b> 
server, to install additional software and to start a process on the server 
which listens for commit messages from <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> requesting the generation of an 
app for an author.

<p>To reiterate: all server administration is done remotely by editing and 
running this program locally.

<pre>
  perl /home/phil/AppaAppsPhotoApp/AppaAppsPhotoApp.pm
</pre>
  
<p>/home/phil/AppaAppsPhotoApp/AppaAppsPhotoApp.pm uses the modules from <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">cpan</a>. These modules can be 
installed locally by using the following command:

<pre>
  sudo cpan -iT \
  Android::Build\
  Aws::Polly::Select\
  Carp\
  CGI\
  Data::Dump\
  Data::GUID\
  Data::Send::Local\
  Data::Table::Text\
  Data::Unique::Name\
  Digest::MD5\
  Digest::SHA\
  File::Copy\
  GitHub::Crud\
  Google::Translate::Languages\
  ISO::639\
  JSON\
  Storable\
  Test::More\
  Text::Numbers::100\
  Time::HiRes\
  Unicode::UTF8 
</pre>

<p>If you do not have all these modules already installed please run the above 
command to install them.

<p>You will need some basic familiarity with <a 
href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> programming. The first few lines of this 
program set up various constants used extensively elsewhere.  At a minimum you 
should review the values of the following constants, as most of the other 
constants are derived from them:

<pre>
my $develop 
sub domain  
sub homeUser
</pre>

<p>The definitions of the servers to be administered are located at line:

<pre>
#ssss                                       
</pre>

<p>This program assumes that the servers can all be addressed as sub hosts of 
<b>domain</b>.

<p>Once the constants are set to your satisfaction, actions can be performed by 
setting <b>$action</b> to one of the values below and then running:

<pre>
 perl /home/phil/AppaAppsPhotoApp/AppaAppsPhotoApp.pm 
</pre>
